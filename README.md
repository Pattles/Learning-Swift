# Learning Swift
I'm learning Swift through Codecademy and other tools, and I'll be posting my solutions to puzzles and tests in this repository. 

My goal is to make an IOS app that'll essentially be a hub for me and my friends. I plan on having it include a marketplace with virtual currency that has no real value (wins), a leaderboard with users with the most wins, and maybe a chatting option.
